————————————————————————   QTL   —————————————————————————-
1.First create a variable called qtl_name as follows
  qtl_name = specieslink_abv.[qtl_symbol]<space>[qtl_identifier]
2.qtl_name must be unique within QTL spreadsheet else issue an error.
3.Check for qtl_name of type 'QTL'(cvterm_id) and 'sequence'(cv) in the database[feature table].
  If already exists in DB, do the following :-
  ---issue warning saying that the QTL already exists.
  ---Check if the publication name associated with qtl in DB is same as the current publication name. If not same, issue an error
4.publink_citation_exp field value if not present in QTL_EXPERIMENT sheet
  and if also doesn't exist in the database[project table], issue an error.
5.Check if qtl_symbol field value exists in Master Trait Sheet. If exists, nothing to do.
  But, if doesn't exist, check if qtl_symbol exists in the database[cvterm table] with name = qtl_symbol
  AND cv = LegumeInfo:traits (or) SOY (or) soybean_whole_plant_growth_stage (or) soybean_development (or) soybean_structure (or) soybean_trait
  If doesn't exist even in database[cvterm_table], issue an error.
  
DECLARATION: If the [RULEZ] field value is not null/empty, then create a variable called uniq_marker_name as follows
             For now, the uniq_marker_name is same as value in [RULEZ] field.
             --[RULEZ] field value if not present in MARKER sheet of master marker workbook
             AND if also doesn't exist in the database[feature table] associated with the corresponding species, issue a warning.
  
6.RULEZ = nearest_marker in the above DECLARATION.
7.RULEZ = flanking_marker_low in the above DECLARATION.
8.RULEZ = flanking_marker_high in the above DECLARATION.
9.specieslink_abv field value must have an associated record in the database[organism table]. Else issue an error

—————————————————————      MAP_POSITION   —————————————————————
1.Create a variable 'qtl' as follows
  qtl = [qtl_symbol]<space>[qtl_identifier]
2.Create a variable 'map' as follows
  map = [map_name field value]-[lg field value]
3.The variable 'map' created in Rule 2, must not be null/empty. Else issue an error.
  If 'map' is not null/empty, then
  --check if the same 'map' variable value exists in MAP sheet
  --If not existing in MAP sheet, then check in the database[feature table]
  --If still not existing in the database too, then issue a warning.
4.If the variable 'qtl' which is created above, doesn't exists in the QTL sheet, then issue an error.
5.Neither left_end field value nor right_end field value can be null/empty.
  If atleast one of these two fields is null/empty, issue an error.
6.If left_end field value is greater than right_end field value, issue an error.
